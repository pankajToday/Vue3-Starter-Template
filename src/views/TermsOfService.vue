                        <p><strong>PAYMENT FACILITY FOR BUYERS: </strong>You, as a Buyer, understand that upon initiating a Transaction, You are entering into a legally binding and enforceable contract with the Seller to purchase the products and /or services from the Seller using the Payment Facility, and You shall pay the Transaction Price through Your Issuing Bank to the Seller using Payment Facility. You, as a Buyer, may agree with the Seller through electronic communication and electronic records and using the automated features as may be provided by Payment Facility on any extension / increase in the Dispatch and/or Delivery time and the Transaction shall stand amended to such extent. Any such extension / increase of Dispatch / Delivery time or subsequent novation / variation of the Transaction should be in compliance with Payment Facility Rules and Policies. You, as a Buyer, shall electronically notify Payment Facility using the appropriate Platform features immediately upon Delivery or non-Delivery within the time period as provided in Policies. Non notification by You of Delivery or non- Delivery within the time period specified in the Policies shall be construed as a deemed Delivery in respect of that Transaction. In case of Cash on Delivery transactions, Buyer is not required to confirm the receipt of products or services. You, as a Buyer, shall be entitled to claim a refund of the Transaction Price (as Your sole and exclusive remedy) in case You do not receive the Delivery within the time period agreed in the Transaction or within the time period as provided in the Policies, whichever is earlier. In case you do not raise a refund claim using Platform features within the stipulated time than this would make You ineligible for a refund. You, as a Buyer, understand that the Payment Facility may not be available in full or in part for certain category of products and/or services and/or Transactions as mentioned in the Policies and hence You may not be entitled to a refund in respect of the Transactions for those products and /or services. Except for Cash on Delivery transaction, refund, if any, shall be made at the same Issuing Bank from where Transaction Price was received, or through any other method available on the Platform, as chosen by You. For Cash on Delivery transactions, refunds, if any, will be made via electronic payment transfers. Refund shall be made in Indian Rupees only and shall be equivalent to the Transaction Price received in Indian Rupees. For electronics payments, refund shall be made through payment facility using NEFT / RTGS or any other online banking / electronic funds transfer system approved by Reserve Bank India (RBI). Refunds may be supported for select banks. Where a bank is not supported for processing refunds, You will be required to share alternate bank account details with us for processing the refund. Refund shall be conditional and shall be with recourse available to our platform in case of any misuse by Buyer. We may also request you for additional documents for verification. Refund shall be subject to Buyer complying with Policies. We reserve the right to impose limits on the number of Transactions or Transaction Price which we may receive from on an individual Valid Credit/Debit/ Cash Card / Valid Bank Account/ and such other infrastructure or any other financial instrument directly or indirectly through payment aggregator or through any such facility authorized by Reserve Bank of India to provide enabling support facility for collection and remittance of payment or by an individual Buyer during any time period, and reserves the right to refuse to process Transactions exceeding such limit. We reserve the right to refuse to process Transactions by Buyers with a prior history of questionable charges including without limitation breach of any agreements by Buyer with our platform or breach/violation of any law or any charges imposed by Issuing Bank or breach of any policy. We may do such checks as it deems fit before approving the receipt of/Buyer&rsquo;s commitment to pay (for Cash On Delivery transactions) Transaction Price from the Buyer for security or other reasons at our sole discretion. As a result of such check if we are not satisfied with the creditability of the Buyer or genuineness of the Transaction or other reasons at its sole discretion, we shall have the right to reject the receipt of/Buyer&rsquo;s commitment to pay Transaction Price. For avoidance of doubt, it is hereby clarified that the &lsquo;Cash on Delivery&rsquo; feature for payment, may be disabled for certain account users, at our sole discretion. We may delay notifying the payment confirmation i.e., informing Seller to Dispatch, if we deems it suspicious or for Buyers conducting high transaction volumes to ensure safety of the Transaction and Transaction Price. In addition, we may hold Transaction Price and we may not inform Seller to Dispatch or remit Transaction Price to law enforcement officials (instead of refunding the same to Buyer) at the request of law enforcement officials or in the event the Buyer is engaged in any form of illegal activity. The Buyer and Seller acknowledge that we will not be liable for any damages, interests or claims etc. resulting from not processing a Transaction/Transaction Price or any delay in processing a Transaction/Transaction Price which is beyond our control.</p>
